Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        - inline only takes up the space it needs, block takes up the whole line.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        - it stays in that absolute position relative to it's parent, as long as the parent is set to relative position. If not, it will default to the body.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        - flex-basis = your desired width, but flex-grow and flew-shrink will allow it to change reactively.
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        - block = p h1 div, inline = span, a
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
        - Everything is in boxes with borders, margins, padding etc. But when you need those boxes to stack or align next to eachother, the dimensions have to be perfect. 
        Unfortunately the size of these boxes change with padding and borders so low and behond we have a fix:  box-sizing:border-box  This means the box size won't change (margins are the only exception)
